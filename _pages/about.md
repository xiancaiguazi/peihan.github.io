I am a Master student at Cooperative Intelligent Unmanned System (CIUS) Lab@SJTU advised by [Prof. Wei Dong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hbaEVRMAAAAJ&hl=en).

My main research focuses on **multi-agent system**. Specifically, I am working on formation control of aerial swarms with active vision. I am also interested in developing high-performance aerial platforms.
